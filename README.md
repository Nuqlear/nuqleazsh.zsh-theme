_OSX terminal with [Peppermint](https://noahfrederick.com/log/lion-terminal-theme-peppermint/) theme._
## Specs

It`s very simple theme with support only for git and [virtualenv-promt](https://github.com/tonyseek/oh-my-zsh-virtualenv-prompt) plugins.

## Installation
At first you should install [virtualenv-promt](https://github.com/tonyseek/oh-my-zsh-virtualenv-prompt) plugin.
Then clone repo and copy the theme:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:nuqlear/nuqlezsh.zsh-theme.git
$ cd nuqlezsh.zsh-theme
$ cp nuqlezsh.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes
```

Open your `.zshrc` file and change the theme name to `nuqlezsh`. 
It should look like this:


```bash
export ZSH_THEME="nuqlezsh"
```

Now you can check your terminal.
